phpBB3-JSON-API
===============

JSON/JSONP API endpoints that extend the functionality of phpBB3 to integrate with other things

Cool little endpoints that can be used to safely and securely retrieve various user information from the phpBB3 database via JSON/JSONP requests

These are RAW functions with minimal security checks. There is no ratelimiting or anything else applied, you shouldn't use them in a production environment as is.
